title: Streisand Installation and Usage Guide
type: docs
---

**Streisand** is an application that helps you use proxy servers. It has a user-friendly interface and practical features. It supports **iPhone** and **iPad**, and the interface is very simple. It can bypass network restrictions and enable VPN functions — for example, allowing access to [Google](https://googleaccount.info/zh) and [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt-apk.app/zh) from mainland China.  
Its functionality is similar to [Shadowrocket](https://shadowrocket.ink/zh), Stash, [FlClash](https://flclash.xyz/zh), and [V2Box](https://v2box.pro/zh).  
It supports multiple protocols, including: **VLESS (Reality)**, **VMess**, **Shadowsocks**, **Socks**, **SSH**, **Hysteria (V2)**, **TUIC**, and **Wireguard**.

## 4. Routing Settings

To enhance your VPN experience, we recommend adding **routing rules** — domestic domains and networks should not use the proxy, while only blocked foreign traffic should go through it.  
This ensures smooth domestic access and saves unnecessary proxy bandwidth.

We’ve already defined which traffic bypasses or uses the proxy and regularly update the rules.

To apply these settings, click the **“One-click Import Routing Rules”** button below — this will add the **Bypass Mainland China** routing rules to the app.  
Please click it **on your phone** (desktop clicks won’t work).

After opening the app, go to the **Home** page, tap **Routing**, select **Bypass Mainland China**, then enable the option.
